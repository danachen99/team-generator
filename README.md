# team-generator
Command line application that generates a software engineering team using user input

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow the user, which would be a manager in this case, to create a profile of the team using command line prompts. The user will name the manager of the team and then choose people to add on, such as an engineer or intern, and can continue to do so until they let the program know that they are finished building the team. The user will be required to enter a name, ID, and e-mail for each employee, as well as additional information for different positions, such as office number for the manager, GitHub username for the engineer, and school for the intern. 

## User Story
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## Tools Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js
